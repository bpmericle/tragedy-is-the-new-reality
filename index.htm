         <h2>Disappearance of Truth</h2>
         <time>April 24, 2025</time>
         <div>
            <p>It’s difficult not to feel uneasy about the direction we’re headed. Not because of one political party or
               another, but because of the growing sense that truth itself is being bent—not toward understanding, but
               toward convenience.</p>
      
            <p>We used to aspire to be a nation of many voices—diverse in origin, belief, and experience. That mosaic
               gave us strength. Yet somewhere along the way, our shared vision fractured. The idea of building
               something greater together seems to have taken a backseat to power, profit, and partisanship.</p>
      
            <p>We can’t allow wealth to be our only metric of success. You can’t take it with you. So why not use our
               time here to improve what we’re part of—for ourselves, yes, but also for those who follow? A legacy
               rooted not in accumulation, but contribution.</p>
      
            <p>Truth is not a tool for personal gain. Something either happened or it didn’t. And while there are
               certainly gray areas—nuance, complexity, context—we should never confuse that with manipulation. There is
               a difference between perspective and distortion.</p>
      
            <p>But we’ve surrounded ourselves with so much noise, so many opinions dressed up as fact, that the real
               story too often disappears beneath the surface—or worse, is reshaped into something unrecognizable.</p>
      
            <p>That’s what concerns me most. Not disagreement, but the erosion of a shared sense of what’s real. If we
               can’t begin from the same page, how can we ever write the next chapter?</p>
      
            <p>We owe it to each other to slow down, to ask better questions, and to stay grounded in a curiosity that
               seeks to understand rather than control. The world doesn’t get better by accident. It gets better when we
               stop spinning and start listening.</p>

         <h2>A Fragile Balance</h2>
         <time>April 17, 2025</time>
         <div>
            <p>There was once a time when the structure of our government—three coequal branches—felt like an unshakable
               truth. It was taught to us in school, simplified into tidy diagrams and textbooks: executive,
               legislative, judicial. Each with its powers. Each with its limits. Together, a system of checks and
               balances, designed to keep any one force from overtaking the others.</p>

            <p>But lately, that balance feels more like a memory than a reality.</p>

            <p>I’m not here to point fingers or name parties. This isn’t about political allegiance. It’s about the slow
               unraveling of something we should all hold sacred: accountability, restraint, and the idea that no
               person—or institution—is above the Constitution.</p>

            <p>What worries me is not just the actions of those in power, but the apathy of those watching from the
               sidelines. We scroll, we sigh, we shrug. We treat erosion like entertainment. We accept dysfunction as
               inevitable. But at what cost?</p>

            <p>When one branch asserts dominance without consequence, when the judiciary becomes politicized, when the
               legislative body is reduced to tribalism and performative noise—what is left of the republic we claim to
               uphold?</p>

            <p>I worry that we've become numb to the gravity of what's happening. That the storm is still gathering, and
               we’ve convinced ourselves the weather is fine.</p>

            <p>We don't have to agree on every issue to agree that democracy demands care. It’s not self-sustaining. It
               requires effort, vigilance, and above all, humility. The kind that reminds us we are all—citizens and
               leaders alike—responsible for this fragile experiment.</p>

            <p>We need fewer slogans and more listening. Less winning, more wisdom. Less noise, more accountability.</p>

            <p>This isn't about left or right. It's about whether the foundation is still holding. And if it's not, then
               we owe it to each other to fix it—not for power, not for legacy, but for the possibility of something
               better than this.</p>

            <p>We are not helpless. But we must choose to be engaged.</p>

            <p>And that starts by staying curious, not judgmental. Even now.</p>

            <p><em>Especially</em> now.</p>

         <h2>Be Curious, Not Judgmental</h2>
         <time>April 15, 2025</time>
         <div>
            <p>There’s a moment in every life when we’re faced with something unfamiliar—another person’s belief,
               lifestyle,
               pain, or joy—and we’re given a choice: to judge it or to try and understand it. In a world increasingly
               quick
               to
               label and divide, curiosity is becoming a rare and radical act.</p>
            <p>I’ve been reflecting lately on the way belief—especially belief in a higher power—is used. Faith, in its
               purest
               form, should unite us, expand our perspective, and humble us. But all too often, belief is bent inward,
               reshaped
               to serve the self instead of the whole. Scripture is selectively quoted. Dogma is wielded as a weapon.
               The
               supposed moral compass becomes a mirror reflecting only personal gain.</p>

            <p>Those who twist belief for power or control may truly think they’re devout. But I wonder—don’t they sense
               it?
               That what they’re doing isn’t selfless, but self-serving? That their so-called righteousness is just a
               form of
               masked judgment? Deep down, perhaps they do. The human subconscious is powerful. It can bury truth, but
               it
               rarely silences it completely.</p>
            <p>This is where curiosity must take the lead.</p>
            <p>Instead of judging others for how they believe—or don’t—what if we asked more questions? What shaped
               their
               view
               of the world? What pain have they endured? What are they searching for when they pray, meditate, or
               simply
               breathe?</p>
            <p>We each live inside our own reality, stitched together from memory, experience, and emotion. No one’s
               path is
               the same. But if we’re brave enough to stay curious—truly curious—we begin to see the invisible threads
               that
               connect us. We find empathy. We find compassion. We find possibility.</p>
            <p>And in that shared space of open minds and open hearts, we begin to evolve—not just spiritually, but
               collectively. It is in that space that true prosperity begins. Not wealth. Not status. But peace.
               Understanding.
               Community.</p>
            <p>So be curious. Not judgmental. It might just be the first step toward something greater than yourself—and
               all
               of
               us.</p>

         <time>April 05, 2025</time>
         <p>
            Lately, I've been thinking about how easily we scroll past the end of the world. Another wildfire, another
            war,
            another collapse. And still we log on...

         <p>
            They say the internet amplifies everything. But maybe now it just drowns everything out. Tragedy isn't
            shocking
            anymore—it's Tuesday.
